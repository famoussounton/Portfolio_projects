# Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

This project is an in-depth analysis of the Seattle Airbnb dataset, aiming to uncover key trends, insights, and patterns related to Airbnb listings in Seattle. The goal is to demonstrate the power of data analysis using various tools, including Excel, Tableau, and SQL.

## Project Overview

The Seattle Airbnb dataset contains information about various listings in Seattle, including their price, location, availability, ratings, and more. In this project, I explore the data to identify trends in the real estate market, investigate factors influencing pricing, and offer actionable insights to stakeholders.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Excel**: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and basic analysis.
- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization, creating interactive dashboards to explore the data.
- **SQL**: Used for querying data and performing aggregations to gain deeper insights.

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**  
   - Loaded the dataset into Excel and performed initial cleaning, handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
   - Identified outliers and handled them appropriately to ensure data quality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed basic statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of key variables, including price, ratings, and availability.
   - Analyzed correlations between different variables like room type, location, and price.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Created interactive Tableau dashboards to showcase the relationships between pricing and other factors like location, room type, and availability.
   - Developed visualizations that allowed users to explore the dataset in more depth, such as price distribution by neighborhood.

4. **Insights and Conclusions**  
   - Identified patterns in pricing across different neighborhoods, room types, and seasons.
   - Provided actionable insights that could help Airbnb hosts optimize their pricing strategies and improve their listings.
